# spotify-playlist-folders
 Organize your Spotify playlists into folders.

 - The cache saves your playlist and tracks data even after you close the program. This makes it load faster,
   but it means you have to press the "Update Playlists" button every time you make a change in Spotify to have
   it be reflected in the GUI.

 - Folder data is saved after every change and will be retained even after the program is closed.

 - The Spotify app must be installed and open in order to use the "play" functions.
